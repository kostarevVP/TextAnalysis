This is a practical task from the Ulern.me site where I study. In this project I implemented three classes:
1. SentencesParserTask
2. FrequencyAnalysisTask
3. TextGeneratorTask 

task description:
The ultimate goal of the next three tasks is to make an algorithm for continuing the text, which, having learned from a large text, will be able to offer a plausible continuation of the phrase based on the first word entered.

The whole task is divided into 3 stages:

Dividing the analyzed text into sentences and words.
Compilation of an N-gram model of text based on a list of sentences.
Generation of text according to the N-gram model.
For example, as a result of analyzing the text about Harry Potter, our simple algorithm should be able to generate new, not contained in the source text, but quite realistic phrases:

harry and ron were delighted to hear all about the sorcerer's stone

boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice a minute all summer
